            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in<br>
            my arms and set out walking once more. <span id="underline">I felt deeply<br>
            moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was<br>

            him to be more fragile still. <span id="underline">I felt the need of<br>
            protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that<br>
